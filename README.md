# 100 Days of Code Day 99: Space Race Analysis
This notebook focuses on the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.
## Modules Used
### Numpy
*Although **NumPy** was listed as one of the starting libraries, I did not use it in my take on this project.*
### Pandas
**Pandas** is used to interact with the CSV files and analyze the data in the files used in this project. This includes data cleaning and exploration operations. 
### Plotly
**Plotly** is used in this project to graph various charts used in the notebook.
### MatPlotLib
**MatPlotLib** is used in this project to plot various charts used in this project. 
### Seaborn
**Seaborn** is used to create various graphs in this notebook.  
## Project Files
### Data Folder
The data folder contains the mission_launches.csv file, which is used in this notebook
### Space_Mission_Analysis.ipynb
This file is the Python notebook used to complete this project. For the project itself, it was completed using a [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/). 
## Project Walkthrough
The notebook begins by importing the necessary modules and loading the CSV data into a variable to be used in the project.

With the data loaded, the first part of this project focuses on preliminary data exploration. This includes gathering information about the shape of the DataFrame, number of rows and columns, column names, and checking for NaN values and duplicates. Cleaning operations are then performed to address the NaN and any duplicate values. 

With the DataFrames analyzed and cleaned, the following sections in the notebook focus on performing more analysis and visualization of the data. The subsections in the notebook are as follows and can be further explored in the notebook!
-	Checking the number of launches by organization
-	Checking the number of active versus retired rockets
-	Checking how many missions were successful vs failed missions
-	Visualizing the cost of missions over time
-	Checking the number of launches and failures by country
-	Money spent by the organization on the launch
-	Launches per year and month-to-month basis
-	Launches over time by the top 10 organizations 
-	Diving into the space race: analysis of the USA vs the USSR
    - Charts plotted include launches year over year, failures vs successful launches and who leads in terms of number of launches
## Project Screenshots
Since this project is completed in a Python notebook, there are no screenshots. However, the notebook has various graphs depicting the data analyzed!
